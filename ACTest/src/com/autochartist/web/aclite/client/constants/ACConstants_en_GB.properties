ABCDCharacteristics=Shows three consecutive price swings or trends resembling a lightning bolt on a chart
ABCDWhenItForms=Each turning point (A, B, C, and D) represents a significant high or significant low on a price chart. These points define three consecutive price swings, or trends, which make up each of the three pattern 'legs' of the pattern. These are referred to as the AB leg, the BC leg, and the CD leg
ABCDWhatItSuggests=A potential market reversal. Helps identify possible buying and selling opportunities in almost any market over just about any timeframe. All Fibonacci patterns are based on or include this pattern. Can provide a stronger trade signal when it meets or joins with other patterns
GartleyCharacteristics=A visual, graphic price/time pattern comprising four consecutive price swings or trends. Typically resembles a 'W' or 'M' on a price chart. Contains an ABCD pattern preceded by a significant high or low (point X)
GartleyWhenItForms=Each turning point (X, A, B, C and D) should represent a significant high or significant low on a price chart. These points define four consecutive price swings, or trends, which make up each of the four pattern 'legs.' These are referred to as the XA leg, AB leg, the BC leg, and the CD leg
GartleyWhatItSuggests=A possible market reversal. Could help identify potentially higher-probability buying or selling opportunities in almost any market and over just about any timeframe. Reflects the convergence of Fibonacci retracement and extension levels at point D. May provide a more favorable risk-to-reward ratio
ButterflyCharacteristics=An ABCD pattern, preceded by a significant high or low. Represents a convergence of Fibonacci extension ratios where Point D = an extension of BC and XA, and is formed by two connecting triangles at B
ButterflyWhenItForms=Similar to Gartley patterns â resembling  the letters 'M' or a 'W' on a price chart
ButterflyWhatItSuggests=A probable market reversal. The convergence of Fibonacci extension ratios could provide higher probability for a change in market direction and provide a better ratio of risk-to-reward. Pattern failure may suggest a strong continuation move
ThreeDriveCharacteristics=Formed by three consecutive symmetrical mountain tops (bearish) or three consecutive symmetrical valleys (bullish). Contains two connecting (intertwined) bearish ABCD patterns â also contains a bearish butterfly pattern, completing at the third drive
ThreeDriveWhenItForms=The pattern should  stand out as three distinct, symmetrical drives to a top or bottom as price and time symmetry are key. Typically far less common than a butterfly or Gartley
ThreeDriveWhatItSuggests=A potential market reversal. The market may be at its most bullish or bearish, where a more significant correction may occur. Could offer an exceptionally good risk-to-reward ratio. Pattern failure suggests a strong continuation may be in progress
ThreePointRetracementCharacteristics=Fibonacci retracements are derived from mathematical relationships based on ratios, the most important of which are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%. 
ThreePointRetracementWhenItForms=A Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart (usually a peak and trough) and dividing the distance by those key ratios.
ThreePointRetracementWhatItSuggests=A three point pattern designed to help find a high touchpoint which leads then to a low support area.
ThreePointExtensionCharacteristics=Fibonacci extensions are derived from mathematical relationships based on ratios, the most important of which are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 100%.
ThreePointExtensionWhenItForms=The extension finds support or resistance within the last major move
ThreePointExtensionWhatItSuggests=They are used to help determine where a current move or trend may end.

PriceRangeForecastBody=<br><br>Stop loss and Take profit placement has often been a random choice based on little empirical data. The above graph illustrates the expected price range movement for the selected instrument for the next 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours.<br><br>The information is calculated for specific times of day and days of the week in order to provide the most accurate expected measure of volatility for current market conditions.<br><br>So if you have a trade duration in mind, use the above graph to help you set your exit levels appropriately.<br><br>
HourlyMovementBody=<br><br>Fundamental and Technical traders alike rely on understanding the range of the markets at particular times of the day. The main financial centers of the world all have their unique impact on trading hours. The power of the above graph lies in that you now have access to the six month average of the hourly price ranges at your fingertips.<br><br> Each hour has a correlation to the financial centers around the world. Knowing when you are likely to see volatility in a specific financial instrument, when an instrument consolidates due to lack of participation, and which time are the best to trade, gives you a look into the psychology and flow of the market.<br><br>
DailyMovementBody=<br><br>For any market participant, an understanding of the specific ranges by day of the week can be applied to entries and so effect likely follow-through. The daily movement is a measurement of the high to low range as calculated on a 24-hour basis with the average movement for that day marked within the range.<br><br> The above graph offers insight into what the market is capable of on any given day of the week, and gives helpful detail to fine tuning entries. It can also offer part time traders insight into which days may be best for trading.<br><br>
